## 9 Categories

IconaMoon includes 9 different categories. No matter you’re designing for an eCommerce website or a music player app, you can use our icons to deliver a highly understandable message to users and make the best experience in their journey.

## 5 Styles
Our icons are designed in 5 different styles. Choose yours and make the design pops!

## Pixel-Based Grid
Our entire libarary is designed in a 24px × 24px frame with 2px of padding. They are sharp, catchy and ready to scale up to any sizes.

## Shapes
We designed IconaMoon based on rectangles, circles and lines. That gave us a uniform structure for all icons and that’s just what we want in an icon set!

## Always free!
IconaMoon is totally free and we have plans to release updates every season. More icons to come!
